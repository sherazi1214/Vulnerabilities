# Vulnerabilities

 ## Vulnerabilities
**English:**
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system, network, application, or process that an attacker can exploit to cause harm.
**Urdu:**
Vulnerability ka matlab hai system, network, application, ya process me aisi kamzori jise attacker use karke nuksaan kar sake.

## Types of Vulnerabilities
**English:**

Hardware Vulnerabilities – Flaws in physical components (e.g., CPU design flaws like Spectre/Meltdown).

Software Vulnerabilities – Bugs, coding errors, or misconfigurations in applications/OS.

Network Vulnerabilities – Weakness in network design, protocols, or configurations.

Configuration Vulnerabilities – Weak/default passwords, open ports, improper settings.

Human-related Vulnerabilities – Lack of training, social engineering susceptibility.

Physical Vulnerabilities – Insecure server rooms, lack of physical access control.

**Urdu:**

Hardware – Physical parts ki flaws (jaise CPU bugs).

Software – Coding errors ya misconfigurations.

Network – Network design/protocol ki kamzori.

Configuration – Weak password, open ports, ghalat settings.

Human – Training ki kami, social engineering ka shikar.

Physical – Server room insecure, access control ka na hona.

## Vulnerability Disclosure
**English:**
The process of reporting vulnerabilities to the organization or vendor so they can fix them.

Responsible Disclosure – Report privately, give time to fix before public release.

Full Disclosure – Make it public immediately.

Coordinated Disclosure – Work with vendor/security community to fix before public release.


## Vulnerability Management
**English:**
A continuous process to identify, assess, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities. Steps:

Identify (scanning, assessment)

Evaluate (risk analysis)

Prioritize (based on severity)

Remediate (patch, config change, mitigation)

Verify (re-test)

Document & Monitor (continuous improvement)

**Urdu:**

Continuous process jisme vulnerabilities ko find, analyze, aur fix kiya jata hai:

Identify – Scanning karna

Evaluate – Risk samajhna

Prioritize – Severity ke basis pe rank karna

Remediate – Patch ya fix karna

Verify – Dobara test karna

Document – Record rakhna aur monitor karte rehna

## Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
**English:**
A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw unknown to the vendor and public, with no available patch, and actively exploitable by attackers.
**Urdu:**
Zero-day vulnerability wo flaw hota hai jo vendor/public ko pata nahi hota, koi patch available nahi hota, aur attacker use kar sakta hai.

## Zero-Day Vulnerability Timeline
**English:**

Vulnerability Exists – The flaw is in the system (unknown).

Discovery – Researcher or attacker finds it.

Exploitation – Attacker uses it (if discovered by bad actor first).

Disclosure – Report to vendor/security community.

Patch Release – Vendor fixes the flaw.

Public Awareness – Details become public.

**Urdu:**

Flaw Maujood – System me bug hota hai.

Discovery – Researcher ya attacker find karta hai.

Exploitation – Attacker use karta hai (agar pehle find kare).

Disclosure – Vendor ko report karna.

Patch – Vendor fix release karta hai.

Awareness – Public ko pata chal jata hai.

## System Vulnerabilities
**English:**
Weaknesses in an organization’s IT systems, including:

Outdated software

Weak authentication

Poor access control

Missing patches

Insecure protocols (e.g., Telnet)

**Urdu:**

Organization ke IT system me kamzoriyaan jaise:

Purana software

Weak password system

Access control ka na hona

Patch missing

Insecure protocol ka use
